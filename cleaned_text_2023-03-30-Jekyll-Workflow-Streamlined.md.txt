Streamline Your Jekyll Blogging Workflow From Idea to Deployment with Automation and Browser Extensions  If you want to streamline your Jekyll blog post creation process, you can use a combination of tools and automation to make the process more efficient. Heres a simple workflow that can help you achieve that  1.  Use a notetaking app Use a notetaking app like Google Keep, Evernote, or Notion to jot down your blog post ideas. These apps usually have browser extensions or mobile apps, which makes it easy to quickly capture your thoughts.      2.  Convert text to Markdown When youre ready to write the blog post, use an online tool or an app that supports Markdown, such as Typora, StackEdit, or Dillinger. These tools let you write and preview your blog post in Markdown format and export the content as an MD file when youre done.      3.  Automate the process with GitHub Actions You can automate the process of deploying your Jekyll blog to GitHub using GitHub Actions. Create a GitHub Actions workflow in your Jekyll repository that triggers on push events to the master branch. This workflow should do the following             Checkout your Jekyll repository        Set up Ruby and install Jekyll        Build your Jekyll site        Deploy the built site to your hosting environment e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.  Example of a basic GitHub Actions workflow for Jekyll  yaml name Jekyll Deploy  on   push     branches        master  jobs   deploy     runson ubuntulatest      steps      name Checkout       uses actionscheckoutv2       name Set up Ruby       uses rubysetuprubyv1       with         rubyversion 2.7       name Install dependencies       run          gem install bundler         bundle install       name Build Jekyll site       run bundle exec jekyll build       name Deploy to GitHub Pages       uses peaceirisactionsghpagesv3       with         github_token  secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN          publish_dir ._site   4.  Use browser extensions optional If you prefer working in your browser, you can use browser extensions like Markdown Here or Markdown Web Clipper to quickly convert selected text into Markdown and save it directly to your connected notetaking app.  By implementing this workflow, you can streamline the process of capturing ideas, writing blog posts in Markdown, and deploying your Jekyll blog to GitHub.
