## Streamline Your Jekyll Blogging Workflow: From Idea to Deployment with Automation and Browser Extensions

If you want to streamline your Jekyll blog post creation process, you can use a combination of tools and automation to make the process more efficient. Here's a simple workflow that can help you achieve that:

1.  Use a note-taking app: Use a note-taking app like Google Keep, Evernote, or Notion to jot down your blog post ideas. These apps usually have browser extensions or mobile apps, which makes it easy to quickly capture your thoughts.
    
2.  Convert text to Markdown: When you're ready to write the blog post, use an online tool or an app that supports Markdown, such as Typora, StackEdit, or Dillinger. These tools let you write and preview your blog post in Markdown format and export the content as an MD file when you're done.
    
3.  Automate the process with GitHub Actions: You can automate the process of deploying your Jekyll blog to GitHub using GitHub Actions. Create a GitHub Actions workflow in your Jekyll repository that triggers on push events to the master branch. This workflow should do the following:
    
    -   Checkout your Jekyll repository
    -   Set up Ruby and install Jekyll
    -   Build your Jekyll site
    -   Deploy the built site to your hosting environment (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

Example of a basic GitHub Actions workflow for Jekyll:

```yaml
name: Jekyll Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: 2.7

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        gem install bundler
        bundle install

    - name: Build Jekyll site
      run: bundle exec jekyll build

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./_site
```

4.  Use browser extensions (optional): If you prefer working in your browser, you can use browser extensions like "Markdown Here" or "Markdown Web Clipper" to quickly convert selected text into Markdown and save it directly to your connected note-taking app.

By implementing this workflow, you can streamline the process of capturing ideas, writing blog posts in Markdown, and deploying your Jekyll blog to GitHub.## Streamline Your Jekyll Blogging Workflow: From Idea to Deployment with Automation and Browser Extensions
