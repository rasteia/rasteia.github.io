title: Auto Push Jekyll Post To Github
---

Me: So there is one more step in the automation process I have been trying to implement, I don't know if I need a new py script file or if it can be done simply enough in newpost.py but I need to push the local changes to github.. I use these commands git add . git commit -m "auto date time" git push origin main



AI GPT-4 Respons: You can automate the process of pushing changes to GitHub using the `subprocess` module in your `newpost.py` script. Here's an example of how you can create a function to push changes to GitHub and call it at the appropriate place in your script:

```
pythonCopy codeimport subprocess
from datetime import datetime

# Your newpost.py code here

def push_to_github():
    try:
        # Stage changes
        subprocess.check_call(["git", "add", "."])
        print("Changes staged.")
        
        # Commit changes with a timestamp
        commit_message = f"Auto commit at {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}"
        subprocess.check_call(["git", "commit", "-m", commit_message])
        print(f"Changes committed: {commit_message}")
        
        # Push changes to the remote repository
        subprocess.check_call(["git", "push", "origin", "main"])
        print("Changes pushed to GitHub.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error pushing changes to GitHub: {e}")

# In your main function or at the end of your script
push_to_github()

```

Replace the placeholders with your actual `newpost.py` code, and make sure to call `push_to_github()` at the appropriate place in your script (e.g., in your main function or at the end of your script). This will automatically stage, commit, and push the changes to GitHub after the rest of your script has executed.

Keep in mind that you may want to run this function after running `tts.py` and `newimage.py` to ensure all changes are pushed to GitHub at the end of the process.
