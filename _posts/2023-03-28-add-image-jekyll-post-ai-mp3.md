title: Adding A Post Image To Jekyll Blog
---

Adding a post image to your Jekyll blog using the Hydeout theme is a simple process. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to add an image to a Jekyll post using Markdown syntax.

First, let's assume that you have an image file you want to use saved in your Jekyll site's directory. For the purposes of this example, we'll use an image called "example-image.jpg" saved in the "assets/images" folder.

To add an image to your Jekyll post, follow these steps:

Open the Markdown file for the post you want to add the image to. This will typically be located in the "_posts" directory of your Jekyll site.

In the Markdown file, create a new line where you want the image to appear.

Use the following Markdown syntax to add the image:

```css
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
```
Replace "/path/to/img.jpg" with the relative path to your image file. In our example, this would be:

```javascript
![Example Image](/assets/images/example-image.jpg "Example Image")
```
This syntax creates an HTML img tag with the specified image file as the source. The alt text and optional title attributes are for accessibility and SEO purposes.

Save your changes to the Markdown file and reload the page to see the image in your post.

That's it! You should now have an image displayed in your Jekyll post. Remember to adjust the path to your image file as needed and to ensure that the image file is saved in the correct directory within your Jekyll site.Adding a post image to your Jekyll blog using the Hydeout theme is a simple process.
